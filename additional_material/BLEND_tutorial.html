  Main
  aim of this tutorials is to get users acquainted with the program
  BLEND (<A HREF="#references">Foadi et al, 2013</A>) and to show how it can be used effectively
  to obtain complete data sets out of several partial or complete ones.
  The reader interested in exploring pros and cons of using data from
  multiple crystals can refer, for instance, to <A HREF="#references">Liu et al. (2011)</A>,

 For convenience both tutorials can be carried out inside a same directory and specific results
 can be collected in separate sub-directories. We will assume that "blend_tutorial" is the name of
 the overall directory and that it has been created in the $HOME area. Different directory
 names and locations can be used, but appropriate modifications will have to be applied to the paths 
 displayed in this document. 
 Data downloaded using the above links, when unpacked, yield a directory named "data". For the rest of
 the tutorials this directory can be moved inside "blend_tutorial".
 There are three groups of data in the sub-directory “data”.
 One group is formed by crystals of insulin, the second by crystals of
 lysozyme and the third still by lysozyme soaked with bromine.

 The first tutorial will be illustrated with and without use of the CCP4

interface, but the user

 <FONT SIZE=4>
 The CCP4 interface associates a project directory to an
 already-existing physical directory in your computer file system. Thus we
 need to create a directory before anything else. Let's call this directory “insulin”
 (it is assumed you are in the blend_tutorials directory):
 </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
 <FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000">
 mkdir insulin

</P>
<P>
 <FONT SIZE=4>
 Next we need to associate a
 project directory called “BLEND_TUTORIAL_INSULIN” to the insulin
 directory just created. You can do this using “Directories &amp;
 ProjectDir” in ccp4i. Now that the project directory has been
 created let us change to the “BLEND_TUTORIAL_INSULIN” one using
 “Change Project” in ccp4i. Everything is now ready to start
 practising with BLEND.
 </FONT>

 <FONT SIZE=4>
 Insulin data have been collected at the Diamond Light Source
 synchrotron and integrated using <I>MOSFLM</I>. Angular rotation
 range varies from data set to data set, as these have been collected
 from different crystals. Please, explore some of these integrated
 data clicking “View Any File” in  ccp4i and selecting the “mtz
 MTZ” field in “File type”.

 In the CCP4 GUI, BLEND can be found either in the “Data Reduction and
 Analysis” or the “Program List” section on the left. When
 started, BLEND section looks like the following:

 To
 begin with we run BLEND in analysis mode, with the main goal of
 creating clusters of data that can, potentially, merge well together.
 After having filled the blank fields with the appropriate paths and
 keywords, the above interface should resemble this:

 After the run in analysis mode, we can look at the output using ccp4i

 Cell
 sides, cell angles, cell volume and mosaicity can be viewed for all
 the 14 data sets included in this insulin tutorial. Numerical values
 can be explored within the same view. More files have been produced
 by this run of BLEND in analysis mode. These are listed by selecting
 “View Files from Job” → “blend_1”:

 In fact “blend_1” is a directory under the “insulin” directory,
 containing all files produced by this run of BLEND. The most
 important among these files is possibly the dendrogram (file
 “tree.ps” and file “tree.png”). Both the PNG and PS files
 display the same dendrogram. They can be viewed using any graphical
 tool, but, at present, only the PS file can be visualised using the
 CCP4 GUI:

 The
 numbers in red are the Linear Cell Variation (LCV) values (and the
 associated absolute LCV in &Aring;) for
 the top five clusters. They give an indication of cell similarity
 among all crystals included in the specific cluster; thus,
 ultimately, they can be associated with isomorphism between different
 data sets. In the above dendrogram we can see two clusters with
 similar cell variability (0.44% and 0.48%, corresponding to 0.36 &Aring; and
 0.39 &Aring; respectively).The variability is
 more than doubled when these clusters merge into the overall cluster
 containing all 14 data sets; this is probably an indication of some
 minor form of non-isomorphism. Tests done so far with BLEND show that
 some structural dissimilarities can be noticed for values of LCV
 higher than 1 – 1.5%.
 </FONT>
</P>
<P>
 <FONT SIZE=4>
 LCV
 values for all clusters are reported in the file “CLUSTERS.txt”:

 This
 is, essentially, a numerical version of the dendrogram and, as we
 will see, is often useful to run BLEND in synthesis mode.
 Another
 useful file in directory “blend_1” is “BLEND_SUMMARY.txt”,
 which is essentially a table reporting cell parameters and other
 quantities for each data set.
 The unique serial number assigned by BLEND to each data set can be found
 in the “FINAL_list_of_files.dat” file. For us this file looks
 like the following:
 </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<br>

<img src="imagesBT/BLEND_0.5.1_tutorial_html_57f4ebdf.png" WIDTH=1500>

</P>
<P>
 <FONT SIZE=4>
 The
 first column contains full path to all input data files; the second
 contains the serial number assigned to input files; the fourth and
 fifth column list initial and final image numbers, while the third
 lists the last image BLEND will include for all subsequent scaling
 and merging jobs. Numbers in these column have been calculated
 through the procedure to get rid of radiation damaged images. In the
 specific case the only data set where images will be discarded is
 data set 9, for which BLEND suggests to remove from image 108 to
 image 122. The last column include resolution cuts suggested by BLEND
 for all subsequent scaling and merging jobs. These are worked out
 using intensity averages decay with resolution, and are controlled by
 keyword ISIGI.
 </FONT>
</P>
<P>
 <FONT SIZE=4>
 All
 input data files were assigned a serial number; this is not always
 the case, because sometimes individual data sets are excluded as they
 contain multiple wedges or other irregular features, and BLEND does
 not accept them in the group to be further analysed. There might also
 be reasons for which the user does not want to consider some of the
 files included in the data directory (for example if they belong to
 an unwanted experiment). In this case the user can make use of the
 file “mtz_names.dat”, also included in directory “blend_1”,
 to re-run BLEND using less input data. File “mtz_names.dat” looks
 like the following:
 </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>

<br>
<img src="imagesBT/BLEND_0.5.1_tutorial_html_m56f415ec.png">
<br>
<br>
</P>
<P>
 <FONT SIZE=4>
 In
 order to use it, suppose we are not any longer interested in the last
 4 files. We first copy “mtz_names.dat” into a file called
 “original.dat”, in a newly-created directory called
 “amended_insulin”:
 </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
 <FONT SIZE=4  COLOR="#008000">	
 mkdir amended_insulin
 <br>
 cp insulin/blend_1/mtz_names.dat amended_insulin/original.dat
 </FONT>
</P>
<P>
 <FONT SIZE=4>
 At
 this point the last 4 files can be deleted from “original.dat”
 file which, now, looks like the following:
 </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<br>
<br>
<img src="imagesBT/BLEND_0.5.1_tutorial_html_m3f540f39.png">
<br>
<br>
</P>
<P>
 <FONT SIZE=4>
 Next,
 we associate this directory to a new project directory in ccp4i,
 called “BLEND_TURORIAL_AMENDED_INSULIN”, and select this project
 directory. BLEND can now be executed again in analysis mode, this
 time selecting  the “original.dat” file as starting point, rather
 than the whole directory containing all 14 insulin data sets:

<P ALIGN=CENTER>

</P>
<P>
 <FONT SIZE=4>
 The
 usual files will be produced (still in directory “blend_1”, but
 inside directory “amended_insulin”), although this time BLEND
 will have dealt with 10, rather than 14 data sets, and the dendrogram
 will look different from the one previously obtained:

<P>
 <FONT SIZE=4>
 As
 numbering of the 10 data sets has not been modified, one can see that
 clusters for these data include the same elements of corresponding
 clusters in the previous example, with the exclusion of data sets
 numbered 11 to 14.
 </FONT>
</P>
<P>
 <FONT SIZE=4>
 Having
 shown how BLEND in analysis mode can be re-executed using a
 subset of data, let us go back to the previous working directory by
 selecting “BLEND_TUTORIAL_INSULIN” project directory in ccp4i.
 Let's try and increase or decrease image cutting due to radiation
 damage, by using the RADFRAC keyword. An input value of 0.85 means
 that we would like to keep only images for which intensities have, on
 average, been dampened by less than 15% of their initial value. Input
 for RADFRAC can be included via ccp4i as shown here:

<br>
<br>
</P>
<P>
 <FONT SIZE=4>
 This
 time “FINAL_list_of_files.dat” shows some difference in the
 number of images discarded. For data set 9 discarded images range 102
 to 122, while before it ranged 108 to 122, and images 93 to 100 are
 now discarded from data set 7, while no images had bee discarded in
 the previous case:

<br>
<br>
</P>
<P>
 <FONT SIZE=4>
 Let's
 modify RADFRAC once more and use 0.65, rather than 0.85. As a result:
 </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
</P>
<P>
 <FONT SIZE=4>
 Images
 discarded are now less because we have allowed for intensities to be
 dampened, on average, by up to 35% of their starting value.
 A similar data exclusion can be applied in resolution terms, by
 changing value to the keyword ISIGI. For instance, let's re-run BLEND
 in analysis mode (with RADFRAC 0.75 - default value), fixing ISIGI to
 3:

 Results
 should be produced in directory “blend_4”. The
 “FINAL_list_of_files.dat” looks as follows:
 </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>

<br>
</P>
<P>
 <FONT SIZE=4>
 Resolution
 cutoffs have now changed. For the first data set the highest is
 2.304, while previously it was 1.920. We expect an increase if the
 value of ISIGI is lowered. This is normally the case. But in the
 specific insulin example data are exceptionally good, and their
 signal-to-noise ratio is quite high to the very highest resolution.
 Thus, results will not change here if values lower than 1.5 are used
 for ISIGI.
 </FONT>

<P>
 <FONT SIZE=4>
 Let's
 pay a closer look at the results of cluster analysis, as described in
 file “CLUSTERS.txt”:
 </FONT>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<img src="imagesBT/BLEND_0.5.1_tutorial_html_m4c812b9a.png">

 <FONT SIZE=4>
 Cluster
 numbers and corresponding data sets are listed in column 1 and column
 6 respectively. The second column reports how many data sets form the
 specific cluster, while in column 3 it is found the exact height at
 which data sets merge to form the cluster. Columns 4 and 5 lists all LCV and aLCV
 values. The dendrogram encourages people to look for grouping of
 individual data sets. Larger groups attract one's attention more than
 smaller groups. In this sense the presence of two clusters, cluster
 (1 2 4 3 14) and cluster (5 6 8 10 11 12 7 9 13), is immediately
 perceived. Very soon, though, we realise that the second cluster is
 made up of two smaller clusters, cluster (5 6 8 10) and cluster (11
 12 7 9 13). Finer details and even smaller clusters can be singled
 out by proceeding to the lower part of the dendrogram. This way of
 proceeding through the dendrogram interpretation can have some
 validity, but is highly subjective. In BLEND it is found that
 a more logical, straightforward and objective way of interpreting the
 dendrogram is to assume that each node can represent a valid data
 set. Subsequent operations of space group assignment (POINTLESS)
 and scaling (AIMLESS) determine the degree of validity. This
 interpretation is accomplished with BLEND synthesis
 execution mode. From “CLUSTERS.txt” we read that everything
 merges at height 13.670. If the user wishes to produce results for
 all nodes under a certain height, it will suffice to specify this in
 the GUI. For instance, to produce results for all nodes in the
 insulin example, the BLEND section of the GUI will look like this:

 After
 execution, several files will be produced in directory “blend_5”
 (this is the fifth job for the GUI under project directory
 “BLEND_TUTORIAL_INSULIN”), including another directory packed
 with files, called “merged_files”:

 In
 this directory one can find unscaled (produced by POINTLESS) and
 scaled (produced by AIMLESS) files corresponding to all nodes
 selected in the dendrogram. Final overall merging statistics can be
 found in the “MERGING_STATISTICS.info” file:

 Values
 are sorted on increasing completeness, followed by lower Rmeas.
 Higher completeness is often associated with high redundancy
 (multiplicity), but also with poor isomorphism, because many more
 data sets are needed for both completeness and multiplicity to
 increase. For example, cluster 12 is 100% complete, as it is cluster
 4, but this last cluster has lower Rmeas, quite certainly because it
 is the union of just two data sets, while cluster 12 includes nine
 data sets. A good result is represented by cluster 2, which has Rmeas
 = 0.088 and it is 99.7% complete. Cluster 5 is an even better choice;
 it has same Rmeas than cluster 2, but a much lower Rpim. It is a
 nearly complete set and has high multiplicity. This is what it should
 probably be used. A visual version of the above table is provided by
 the “Rmeas_vs_Cmpl.png” or “Rmeas_vs_Cmpl.ps” plot:

 From
 the overall view provided by this plot we can see that 2 and 5 are
 the best data sets in terms of statistics and completeness (they are
 barely visible because they overlap on top of each other). Unscaled
 and scaled files related to all results, in the “merged_files”
 directory, can be inspected with the usual CCP4 tools (try, for
 instance, to view “scaled_005.mtz”). POINTLESS and AIMLESS logs
 for all unscaled and scaled files are also included in this
 directory. For instance, the final part of the AIMLESS log
 file for cluster 5 shows:

 There might be reasons for
 which the user wishes to calculate results for certain nodes only,
 rather than for all nodes of the dendrogram. This can be done using
 two numerical values, rather than one, in BLEND synthesis.
 Suppose we only want to calculate data for cluster (5 6 8 10). This
 cluster merges at a height of 0.744 (check “CLUSTERS.txt”). Two
 numerical values in between which 0.744 and no other nodes is
 included are 0.745 and 0.743. Thus, to produce a synthesis just for
 this cluster, one can run BLEND as follows:

 Statistics and related files
 for only one data set are contained within the “merged_files”
 directory.
 Suppose we want to extend
 resolution of the previous result from 1.93 to 1.80. BLEND can
 be again executed in synthesis mode using the appropriate
 "RESOLUTION" keyword:

 Check statistics under the
 new “merged_files” directory, they should have changed to include
 the desired resolution cutoff.
 "MERGING_STATISTICS.info" allows people to gain a better
 understanding of the ability individual data sets have to form
 larger, more complete and isomorphous groups. For example, in job
 number 5, it clearly emerges that cluster 5, composed of data sets 7,
 9, 13, has good merging statistics and it is very complete. The two
 additional data sets joining 7, 9, 13 and forming cluster 10, i.e.
 data sets 11 and 12, make the situation worse, because scaling with
 AIMLESS fails (results given as "NA"). In cases like this
 it is useful to re-run BLEND using specific keywords, only for
 that specific node, using BLEND in combination mode. The "NA"
 for cluster 10 can be investigated by looking at the AIMLESS
 log inside the "merged_files_all" directory (file
 "aimless_010.log"):

 AIMLESS stopped
 abruptly while trying to compute standard errors (SD). This is, at
 present, a potentially frequent occurrence in AIMLESS,
 whenever combinations from multiple data sets are involved. Most of
 the time it is caused by the failed refinement of standard errors. A
 possible way out is through the addition of a same set of SD
 parameters for all data sets (SDCORR SAME). Alternatively, it is
 possible to give up with SD refinement (thus having poor errors
 estimate) altogether (SDCORR NOREFINE). Let's re-run BLEND
 using keyword SDCORR SAME:

 Now time BLEND
 returns a scaled data set with valid merging statistics (Rmeas =
 0.119, Rpim = 0.042). The result can be found in the newly-created
 directory "combined_files". This directory can be progressively
 populated with many different combinations. Data sets and merging
 statistics for other failed BLEND synthesis jobs can be
 attempted in a similar way (try yourself clusters 6 and 13).

 Running BLEND in
 combination mode it is also possible to compute merging statistics
 for groups of data sets not corresponding to any cluster. Thus, for
 example, we might want to investigate whether data set 11 or data set
 12 make statistics for cluster 5 worse. First we try with 11
 (remember to use always the keyword line SDCORR SAME). In order to
 have results from this run included in the same "combined_files"
 directory from a previous run in combination mode, we will have to
 select that specific directory in the GUI:

 Next we try with 12 (don't
 forget to use "blend_9" as path to earlier BLEND directory).
 After these last two runs, the population for the last
 "combined_files" directory include files for three groups:

 Checking
 file "MERGING_STATISTICS.info" leads to the conclusion that
 statistics are better with data set 11. Thus we can decide to
 "filter out" data set 12 from cluster 10, in order to achieve a
 better composite data set. Results can also be viewed using the "new

 Like any other CCP4 program, BLEND
 can be executed without using ccp4i, simply typing commands at the
 keyboard in an interactive command shell. This, quite often, makes
 the program more flexible.
 Here we will briefly repeat all
 steps previously carried out with ccp4i. First a new directory, named
 for example "insulin_no_ccp4i" will be created in order to keep
 this part of the tutorial separate from the rest:
 </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
 <FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000">
 mkdir insulin_no_ccp4
 <br>
 cd insulin_no_ccp4
 </FONT>
</P>
<P>
 <FONT SIZE=4>
 Next we run BLEND in analysis mode
 using all 14 files in the "data/insulin" directory:
 </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
 <FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000">
 blend -a ../data/insulin
 </FONT>
</P>
<P>
 <FONT SIZE=4>
 After start the program
 immediately halts, waiting for keywords input; in this specific
 instance we simply push the "Enter" key once, thus forcing BLEND
 to use default values. At completion the program produces the
 following files:
 </FONT>
</P>
<P>
 <FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff">

 <br>

 </FONT>
</P>
<P>
 <FONT SIZE=4>
 whose meaning and content has been previously explained.
 To show how "mtz_names.dat"
 can be re-used for a different run of BLEND in analysis mode, and
 similarly to what done previously in this tutorial, let's create a
 directory called "amended_insulin" and copy "mtz_names.dat" in it:
 </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
 <FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000">
 mkdir amended_insulin
 <br>
 cd amended_insulin
 <br>
 cp ../mtz_names.dat original.dat
 </FONT>
</P>
<P>
 <FONT SIZE=4>
 Then "original.dat" is edited
 to remove the last four lines, thus creating a different input,
 consisting only of 10 out of 14 data sets. Next, the program is
 executed using "original.dat" as input:
 </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
 <FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000">
 blend -a original.dat
 </FONT>
</P>
<P>
 <FONT SIZE=4>
 Results of this run are similar to
 what described before. To carry on let's move back one level to
 "insulin_no_ccp4i":

</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
 <FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000">

<P>
 <FONT SIZE=4>
 If a log file is needed, then a
 keyword file has to be prepared before execution. Let's call this
 file "blend_keywords.dat", and play both with RADFRAC and ISIGI
 keywords, changing from their default values 0.75 and 1.5 to the new
 values 0.65 and 3.0. We can also add the "SDCORR SAME" keyword so
 to avoid some scaling jobs to fail (see earlier parts of this
 tutorial). The file looks like this:

 How to obtain complete data sets, while preserving isomorphism with BLEND

 These
 data come from hen egg lysozyme with two different procedures. The
 first group of 12 10-degree sweeps has been collected with pure
 lysozyme crystals at room temperature from crystallisation plates.
 The second group of 16 10-degree sweeps has been obtained from
 crystals soaked in a solution of sodium bromide; data have been
 collected at the Diamond Light Source synchrotron with a wavelength
 close to the bromide peak. Data collection went further than 10
 degrees for each data set, but we have limited sweeps in order to
 replicate similar situations met when radiation damage acts fast. For
 this tutorial in situ data have been stacked with data collected at
 low temperature and from a slightly different structure (additional
 bromide content) in order to demonstrate the interplay between
 completeness and non-isomorphism.

 The

 Data
 consist of many short sweeps (not useful to form a complete data
 set), therefore we can get rid of sweeps 19 and 21 without loosing
 much data and re-run BLEND in analysis mode. One way of
 executing BLEND using the same data without sweeps 19 and 21
 is by renaming file "mtz_names.dat" as "original.dat" and
 deleting the lines pointing to these sweeps:

 As
 we can see, the new LCV is much smaller, although the value 1.68% (and the absolute LCV value 1.54 &Aring;)
 still indicates some non-isomorphism among all crystals. We know this
 is the case because crystals have been assembled from
 differently-prepared structures. Indeed, LCV values computed
 separately for the left branch and for the right branch of the
 dendrogram return  0.69% and 0.72%, respectively. Incidentally, data
 sets group 1 – 12 has different features from group 13 – 26
 (remember, two sweeps missing from the initial group!) because it
 corresponds to a different collection from a different group of
 crystals. This coarse division, observed in the two separate
 dendrogram's branches, can also be hinted by looking at the different
 mosaicity trends in BLEND log file:

 Scaled
 data for all nodes of the new dendrogram can be computed running
 BLEND in synthesis mode. We know that all data should belong
 to space group P 4<SUB>3</SUB> 2<SUB>1</SUB> 2. We also would like to
 use the same resolution for all data, say 1.9 &Aring;.
 Accordingly, the program is executed using the following keywords:

 Keyword
 TOLERANCE is set to a high value to bypass the default tendency of
 POINTLESS to stop execution when cell parameters differ too
 much. Considering now the dendrogram, using only one value for the
 height means that the program would process all nodes below this
 value. In the "CLUSTERS.txt" file it can be seen that these have
 values smaller or equal to 28.861; thus any value larger than this
 produces the desired scaled data:

 Scaled
 files corresponding to these results are included in the
 "merged_files" directory, and they are ready for further
 investigations. Some of the statistics can be improved by filtering
 out certain sweeps from specific clusters. A visualization of the
 above table is provided in the following picture,
 where clusters with completeness around 90% or better are represented
 by grey circles and the corresponding R<SUB>meas</SUB> value is typed

 Clusters
 21, 22, 23 and 25 have clearly unacceptable R<SUB>meas</SUB> values,
 while values for clusters 15 and 24 can, possibly, be improved. The
 main way to improve statistics at this point is by running BLEND
 in combination mode. Let's try, for instance, to improve the
 statistics for cluster 15. As the R<SUB>meas</SUB> value jumps from
 0.111 for cluster 11 to 0.155 for cluster 15 and as cluster 15 is
 simply cluster 11 with the addition of sweep 23, it is
 straightforward to impute the reason for the increase to the bad
 quality of sweep 23. But there might also be other possibilities. For
 example sweep 23 does not match well some of the sweeps composing
 cluster 11; by excluding these sweeps, then, statistics might
 improve. In conclusion we can try and couple sweep 23 with cluster
 11, excluding in turn one of the sweeps forming cluster 11. For all
 combinations after the first we will have to make sure that the path
 to an earlier BLEND directory points to the results directory of the
 previous combination. So for the first combination:

 The
 lowest R<SUB>meas</SUB> is the one for group 2. Thus, discarding sweep 18 from
 cluster 15 causes Rmeas to improve from 0.155 to 0.135, while
 completeness decrease just of a little from 95.8% to 94.6%. Similar
 combinations can be tried on all other clusters. Results are shown in

 Try
 to reproduce the same results by executing BLEND in
 combination mode. As a hint you can find it useful to know that the
 sweeps discarded are 11, 15, 18 and 22.
 To conclude this tutorial, use BLEND in combination mode with
 just one element at a time to reproduce scaled data and statistics
 for individual sweeps. It is interesting to observe that the 4 data
 sets excluded from the previous filtering job do not always
 correspond to those having worst R<SUB>meas</SUB> values.

 A
 final remark: all scaled mtz files do not contain structure factors,
 but only scaled intensities. To create structure factors and proceed
 with phasing, model building and refinement, you need to run the CCP4
 program TRUNCATE or any other software that does an equivalent
 job.

 Each one of these data sets is not complete. The anomalous signal produced by the heavy bromine atoms can be detected
 even with partial data sets, but effective phasing can only happen reliably with good anomalous completeness. For this
 reason it is necessary to merge data from these multiple crystals to obtain full anomalous completeness. The resulting
 high redundancy makes the anomalous signal even stronger, provided isomorphism is conserved.
 <br>
 In this tutorial we will use BLEND to first explore resolution and completeness of data and then to obtain complete
 data sets that will be subsequently used to find the heavy atom substructure. The CCP4 GUI will not be used, so that the
 whole tutorial is simplified, but the GUi should be used if you are unfamiliar with command line execution.

 First let us create a new directory, called "lysBr" inside the "blend_tutorial" directory:
 </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
 <FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000">

 </FONT>
</P>
<P>
 <FONT SIZE=4>
 Data in this case are stored in directory "lysBr" under "blend_tutorial/data". But they are spread over 12 different directories.
 In order to prepare data for BLEND we have two options; either copy all data into a single directory, or edit a file with paths
 for all 12 input files. In this case the second option is better because all individual input files have been produced by <I>XDS</I>
 and have identical name, "INTEGRATE.HKL". A quick way to prepare the input file for BLEND is to use the unix command "find". First
 let us move inside the "lysBr" directory (our working directory, in this case):

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
 <FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000">

 <br>
 mkdir lysBr
 </FONT>
</P>
<P>
 <FONT SIZE=4>
 Next, use "find" starting from "data/lysBr" directory and re-direct the results into a new file called "original.dat". This file
 is the initial input for BLEND (the "sort" command after the pipe symbol "|" is to sort directory names; it's not needed in general,
 as input file order really does not matter in BLEND, but here it helps the tutorial description):

 The linear cell variation for all crystals has a small 0.69% value, which means all crystals are fairly isomorphous. Among all files produced
 by BLEND in the present working directory the new "xds_files" directory and "xds_lookup_table.txt" file have been produced. This happens every
 time input data come from <I>XDS</I> integration files. BLEND makes use of <I>POINTLESS</I> to turn them into mtz files. All new files,
 including <I>POINTLESS</I> log files, are included in the "xds_files" directory. The "xds_lookup_table.txt" helps users to keep track of
 file origin, because all <I>XDS</I> files are re-named in the process. In this specific case, for example, directory "xds_files" includes
 the following files:

 In order to estimate data resolutions we can run BLEND in combination mode on each individual data set. Strictly speaking
 this is not needed, and merged data corresponding to all clusters can be calculated straight away, but exploring individual
 data sets (in those instances where data wedges and symmetry allow scaling) can help to figure out data quality. We know that
 the space group for these samples of lysozyme is  P 4<SUB>3</SUB> 2<SUB>1</SUB> 2 and can fix this in the keywords file. Thus,
 a new file, named "bkeywords.dat" can be edited to include the following line:

 From the "Completeness" column we can see that the only complete data set is data set 3. Its resolution, as suggested by the
 "Reso CC1/2" and "Reso Mn(I/sd)" columns is around 1.8 &#197. Resolutions are higher for the other partial data sets and it
 seems reasonable to push resolution for combined data at 1.6 &#197. Let us, therefore, run BLEND in synthesis mode to produce
 merged data for all nodes of the dendrogram at this resolution. The corresponding line to add to the BLEND keywords file is
 "RESO HIGH 1.6". We also want to turn anomalous handling of data on in <I>AIMLESS</I>, as we would like to used scaled data
 for subsequent phasing. In the end, the updated "bkeywords.dat" looks like this:
 </FONT>

<P>
 <FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff">
 CHOOSE SPACEGROUP P43212<br>
 RESO HIGH 1.6<br>
 ANOMALOUS ON
 </FONT>
</P>
<P>
 <FONT SIZE=4>
 Then we execute BLEND as follows (the value 10 is high enough in the dendrogram to include all nodes):
 </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
 <FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000">
  blend -s 10 < bkeywords.dat

  All results are, this time, dumped in directory "merged_files". We can appreciate overall statistics by viewing the
  "MERGING_STATISTICS.info" file inside this directory. These statistics, though, give no information we can use to
  judge the quality of data for phasing. This information is still not extracted and organised by BLEND because the
  whole issue is currently under investigations. Future addition in "MERGING_STATISTICS.info" will include such information.
  For now we can extract specific lines from all <I>AIMLESS</I> logs using the unix "grep" command. For instance, an important
  piece of information needed to judge the quality of anomalous data is the anomalous completeness. We can extract such information
  with the following unix line:
 </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
 <FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000">
 grep "Anomalous completeness   " merged_files/aimless*.log
 </FONT>

 The output produced is the following:

 It is immediately seen that clusters with satisfactory anomalous completeness are 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11
 (greater than 90%). These are data sets on
 which we can try the procedure to find heavy atoms substructure. These files will have to be compared with the only individual
 data set with the highest anomalous completeness, data set 3. A "grep" line similar to the one previously used can show this:
 </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
 <FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000">
 grep "Anomalous completeness   " individual_files/aimless*.log
 </FONT>
</P>

 <FONT SIZE=4>
 Resulting output:

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<br>
<img src="imagesBT/lysBr_grep2.png">

<P>
 <FONT SIZE=4>
 The value of 76.8% for the anomalous completeness of data set 3 is nowhere near an acceptable 90%, but it's the only decent one
 obtainable with indvidual data sets, and it is with this one that all merged ones will have to be compared. The message
 to be taken home is that when only partial data are available it is still possible to combine them and obtain a complete data set,
 rather than wait for new crystals and another data collection. Furthermore, the redundancy implied by merging data together can
 increase the anomalous signal and, thus, strengthen the phasing power.<br>
 In what follows we have used the <I>SHELX</I> family of programs to prepare data, measure anomalous signal and find the heavy
 atoms substructure (<A HREF="#references">Sheldrick (2010)</A>). These programs work with input files of a specific format ("sca" files).
 In order to prepare these files we need, first, to turn scaled intensities into structure factors using the CCP4 program <I>TRUNCATE</I>.
 Then we use "MTZ2SCA" to turn mtz files into sca files. Everything will be executed inside a new directory called
 "anoproc". In this directory we need to create seven more directories, one for each data set to be processed. The whole series of
 unix commands to be typed is:
 </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
 <FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000">
 mkdir anoproc<br>
 cd anoproc<br>
 mkdir lysBr_ind_003<br>
 mkdir lysBr_005<br>
 mkdir lysBr_006<br>
 mkdir lysBr_007<br>
 mkdir lysBr_009<br>
 mkdir lysBr_010<br>
 mkdir lysBr_011
 </FONT>
</P>
<P>
 <FONT SIZE=4>
 The procedure to produce sca files ready to be used in <I>SHELX</I> will be now shown only for one of the data sets involved, data set 6,
 but it is meant to be repeated in exactly the same way for all other data sets. First we move to directory "lysBr_006". Then we run
 <I>TRUNCATE</I>, using command lines, in the following way:
 </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
 <FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000">
 cd lysBr_006<br>
 truncate HKLIN ../../merged_files/scaled_006.mtz HKLOUT truncate_006.mtz
 </FONT>
</P>
<P>
 <FONT SIZE=4>
 After having entered this line execution halts as <I>TRUNCATE</I> expects some keywords. We can use default values and
 just type "END" (and hit the "Enter" key). After execution a file "truncate_006.mtz" should appear in the directory. To translate this
 file into a sca file we use <I>MTZ2SCA</I> in a very simple way:
 </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
 <FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000">
 mtz2sca truncate_006.mtz
 </FONT>
</P>
<P>
 <FONT SIZE=4>
 Now also "truncate_006.sca" should be present in the directory. As mentioned before, the procedure just applied on data set 6 should be
 repeated for the other 6 data sets in the "anoproc" directory. Once all sca files have been obtained, programs <I>SHELXC</I> and
 <I>SHELXD</I> can be executed to obtain the heavy atoms substructure. The heavy atom for this specific case is bromine (BR - 8 sites) and we have
 tried 1000 trials in <I>SHELXD</I>. Results are tabulated as follows:

 The phasing power of bromine in a stable structure like lysozyme is clear from the relatively high CCall (> 30)
 for data set "ind_003". It is also clear, though, that the anomalous signal becomes much more effective when multiple
 isomorphous crystals are merged together.
